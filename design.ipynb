    "- All nodes behave the same. That is, no gateway is allowed, the alien keys should be treated at every node. \n",

    "As storing keys maybe very expensive and a small length of key digests for Cuckoo Filter is sufficient for arbitrarily large of key size (according to the figures), the design of Cuckoo based solution is exactly the same as the Cuckoo Filter. There will be no false routing for valid keys. But as for the alien keys, this approach may wrongly math them with existing key digests and thus introduce an \"error path\", or even \"error loop\". \n",

Because the routing table construction at the control plane is optimized so that the same key digest function is used for all nodes and thus if there is one false positive for the alien key, then the alien key will follow the same path with the valid key that collides with it.

When taken into practice, this one-bit cost can be saved while keeping the ability of telling the empty slots from the non-empty ones. Just let the port number 0 to denote the virtual port to drop packets, and let the all zero slots to denote a white slot. This whiteness marking is easily achieve by assuring the first \"free end\" of the connected component is not all zero, then the all zero slots will never show up in the middle, because all values for valid keys are not zero. \n",
